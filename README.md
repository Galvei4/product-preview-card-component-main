## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

I took the mobile screenshot with a resolution of 375px width and 690px height, using Responsive Design Mode (used Firefox), and the desktop version with a resolution of 1440px width and 900px height.

## My Process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### Problems I had

I had some problems when I needed to put the image in the div's background, so I created a media query for the mobile with a minimum width of 375px and a maximum width of 1339px (1px less than the desktop style). It was the only way I got to make it work, and if it works, don't touch it, right?
